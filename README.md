Game Description:
This is a simple shooting game where rotating cubes are your targets. Each cube has a unique rotation speed and direction. The gun is fixed and aims at the bottom-most cube. Every cube has a set number of lives that decrease when hit by a bullet. When a cube's lives are exhausted, it is destroyed, and the next cube becomes the target. You can shoot unlimited bullets, but only one can be fired at a time, with a short delay between shots.

At the start of the game, you can set the number of cubes you want to play with. Additionally, you can toggle sound effects, enable or disable navigation features, and activate or deactivate a timer for a more dynamic experience. The game tracks your performance with a timer that starts when you begin playing. If the timer runs out before clearing all cubes, you lose. Clearing all the cubes within the given time means you win. After each game, both the timer and the number of cubes reset to allow a fresh start. ||
